# GeoTracker

Real time websocket client positioning map. Shows in a map generated by Leaflet the coordinates of the users connected to the Socket.io service.
For the sake of testing in localhost, each new user that connects has its coordinates +1, so that each user can be easily tracked in the map.

## Installation

Install dependencies in both root folder and backend folder
```
npm install
cd backend
npm install
```
Run the server file in the backend folder by running
```node socketServer.js```
and finally run the app with
```npm start```
